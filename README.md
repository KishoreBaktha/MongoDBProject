# MongoDBProject-Android

This android app was built as part of my final year project of UnderGraduate. The app functions as a dynamic storage list 
where the user can use the barcode scanner provided to scan the tag of items and the details of items are automatically
stored into the database. The database used is MongoDB . 
This app serves as a perfect stress reliever to all the data administrators who have the headache of storing all the details
of items manually. 

The user has to just scan the tag of item and the items gets stored into the database. This helps the database administrator 
to avoid storing all the details manually and sometimes having a chance of making mistakes.

The app can also provide the user with an option to complain about the item conditions. The user has to just scan the tag and 
register a complaint. This saves the user ample amount of time as he does not have to enter all the details of the items.

The app was developed and given to SSN College of Engineering for usage.
